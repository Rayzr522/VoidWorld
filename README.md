# VoidWorld

> A simple plugin that generates a completely empty, void world.

This is an updated version of [@chaseoes](https://github.com/chaseoes) [VoidWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/voidworld.29807/) plugin. It now supports 1.13.

## Installation

Just grab the latest JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/VoidWorld/releases) and toss it in your plugins folder!

## Credits

All credits go to [@chaseoes](https://github.com/chaseoes) for the [original source code](https://github.com/chaseoes/VoidWorld). It's admittedly quite simple, but I feel it's still appropriate to provide him with proper credit.
